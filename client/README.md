# Husky-ButterWalk

The cool kids ðŸ˜Ž working on a cool project

Note from Ailsa: only things I changed are app and assets, everything else was from the default project.
Also haven't added a sign in page or anything like that...

# Calling servers

Until we have the server hosted in the cloud, create an .env (copy from .env.sample) file and enter your IP address. You can find this address if you type ipconfig into any terminal and look under 'Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi, then 'IPv4 Address'

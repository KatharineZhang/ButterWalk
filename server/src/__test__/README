Do `npx jest` to run tests.

Tests are set up with Jest to run in ts-node with the provided preset. Arguably, this is fragile
and kind of fucked up, but it works *really* well for debugging which is the only reason I am writing
tests right now. 

Ideally, the entire server should use a general transipler (Babel + Webpack) to produce a standard output 
with associations to the typed source code instead of using tsc, and tests should run on the distribution
bundle as well as in ts-node. This requires additional work that I am not going to do right now.

If you are writing tests and the above sounds like meaningless nonsense[1] talk to Connor Olson or just don't
care and do whatever (up to you).
